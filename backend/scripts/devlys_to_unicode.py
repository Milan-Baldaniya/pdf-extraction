"""Convert DevLys / Kruti Dev legacy Devanagari to Unicode.

    python -m scripts.devlys_to_unicode --selftest
    python -m scripts.devlys_to_unicode --file <pdf> --page 50

Class 10 Hindi A and B extract as `fganh&v d{kk 10` -- zero per cent
Devanagari by codepoint, and unreadable. That is not damage: the pages are set
in DevLys-010 and DevLys-040, legacy fonts whose bytes are Latin characters
standing for Devanagari glyphs. `fganh` is हिंदी. The text layer is intact and
merely mis-encoded, so this is a transliteration and not an OCR problem -- see
[[devanagari-pdf-renders-fine-text-layer-lies]] for the case where it really
is one.

TWO THINGS MAKE THIS MORE THAN A LOOKUP.

  ORDER MATTERS. The mapping is applied longest sequence first, because
  "dks" is को while "d" alone is क and "ks" alone is ो. Applied shortest
  first, every long form is destroyed by its own prefix.

  THE SHORT-I MATRA MOVES. Legacy encodings print ि BEFORE the consonant it
  attaches to, matching how it is drawn; Unicode stores it AFTER. So
  "fganh" is f+g+a+n+h -> ि+ह+ं+द+ी, and the ि has to hop over the
  consonant cluster to its right. Left unmoved, every word containing a
  short i is wrong, and wrong in a way that still looks like Devanagari.

This is a wide mapping and it will not be perfect on every conjunct. Run
`--selftest` before trusting a run: it checks known strings from the book's
own cover, where the expected Unicode is not in doubt.
